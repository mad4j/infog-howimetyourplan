## How I Met Your Plan (and immediately started refactoring it)

This repository contains an infographic-style view of a planning workflow: the kind where you start with a perfectly reasonable goal, add constraints, dependencies, stakeholder feedback, and timelines… and suddenly your “simple plan” becomes a multi-phase saga with plot twists.

### What the diagram is showing (technically speaking)
- **A high-level flow of planning states**: from idea → scoping → decomposition → execution → review (and the occasional “wait, why are we doing this?” loop).
- **Decision points and feedback loops**: because plans aren’t linear; they’re graphs. Sometimes they’re graphs with cycles. Sometimes they’re just *cycles*.
- **Artifacts you typically produce**: tasks, milestones, priorities, and that one spreadsheet that becomes the single point of failure for reality.

### How to read it without losing your sanity
1. Start at the top: assume optimism is enabled by default.
2. Follow the arrows: each one represents either progress or the moment you discovered a hidden dependency.
3. Pay attention to loops: they’re not “mistakes”, they’re **agile**. (That’s what we tell ourselves.)

### Why this is useful
If you’ve ever shipped something successfully, you already know planning is less about predicting the future and more about building a system that survives contact with it. This infographic is a compact map of that system—so you can communicate it, critique it, and improve it… before the plan meets the real world and gets a new name: “incident.”
